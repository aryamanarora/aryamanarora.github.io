  <p>One of the first unfamiliar distinctions that a learner of Sanskrit
    will encounter is <em>parasmaipada</em> vs. <em>ātmanepada</em> verbs.
    They have two different sets of morphological endings—a pain on top of
    the different endings for the 10 root classes—but often no obvious
    difference in meaning. Does it actually matter whether I use
    <em>parasmaipada</em> or <em>ātmanepada</em> forms? Why not stick to one
    to halve the number of endings I need to learn?</p>
    <p>The learner will be taught that prescriptively, <em>parasmaipada</em>
    (or active-voice) verbs refer to actions done for the benefit of others,
    while <em>ātmanepada</em> (or middle-voice<span class="sidenote-number">
        <small class="sidenote">There are also passive-voice verbs, but they do not
          neatly fit in this paradigm since they’re derived with the suffix
          <em>-ya-</em> and then the person/number endings, and they are not
          really in competition like the active- and middle-voice forms are.</small>
    </span>)
    verbs are for actions done for oneself. Take the root पच् <em>pac</em>
    “cook”: if I say पचे <em>pacē</em> you better get your own meal because
    this is <em>ātmanepada</em>, cooking for myself. If I say पचामि
    <em>pacāmi</em> then feel free to take this food. But in reality,
    Sanskrit texts <strong>don’t strictly make this distinction</strong>.
    Many verbs will prefer one or the other for no apparent reason, and
    there is diachronic change in the preference towards one or the other
    with not clear driving factor. Perhaps this distinction was not bearing
    enough functional load to remain necessary over time, but awareness of
    the two forms, especially after Sanskrit became a formally learned
    language rather than an uncodified mothertongue, meant that they
    continued competing throughout Sanskrit’s history.</p>
    <p>Beyond the situation in Sanskrit, the similarity of the forms between
    the two voices meant that by Middle Indo-Aryan, the distinction had
    collapsed phonologically and did not survive (to my knowledge) to the
    present day in any Indo-Aryan language.</p>
    <p>Recently though, I noted a similar feature in Hindi, which I don’t
    think is really a purely morphological distinction yet like in Sanskrit,
    but the parallel is too interesting to dismiss. I’ll call it the
    <strong>reflexive causative</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="टीका-लगवाओ-ṭīkā-lagvāo">टीका लगवाओ <em>ṭīkā lagvāo</em></h2>
    <p>With the continuing spread of coronavirus in India as in much of the
    world, the government has been pushing people to get vaccinated. One
    tool to do that is advertising campaigns. There was a nice video from
    this kind of drive that I saw the other day:</p>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p>टीका लगवाया क्या?</p>
    <p>ṭīkā lag-vā-yā kyā?</p>
    <p>vaccine.M.SG apply-CAUS.IND-M.SG what?</p>
    <p>“Did you get vaccinated?”</p>
    </div>
    <p>One of the things that struck me in that title<span class="sidenote-number">
        <small class="sidenote">As a linguist, it’s inevitably a really trivial thing
          that seems interesting to me.</small>
    </span> is
    that the verb, despite being an <strong>indirect causative</strong> (or
    double causative) that can take 4 core arguments, has only 1 argument,
    <em>ṭīkā</em> “vaccine/vaccination”, indicated explicitly at all.</p>

    <h2 id="a-digression-into-how-hindis-causatives-work"><em>A digression
    into how Hindi’s causatives work…</em></h2>
    <p>Hindi, like other Indo-Aryan languages, has up to a four-way
    morphological gradation of transitivity/causativity on verbs. Basically,
    for every verb, we have up to four forms that vary in terms of how many
    entities are involved in that action. The obvious participants are the
    <strong>subject</strong> (thing doing the action) and
    <strong>object</strong> (action being done to it), but there are some
    less obvious ones that show up in this gradation. An example will show
    this better.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>दिख- dikʰ- “[Subj] is seen”<br>देख- dekʰ- “[Subj] sees [Obj]”<br>दिखा-
    dikʰā- “[Subj] shows [Obj] to [IObj]”<br>दिखवा- dikʰvā- “[Subj] makes
    [Inst] show [Obj] to [IObj]”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The main action in all of these is SEE, but who and what is involved,
    who causes the seeing, etc. varies based on what
    transitivity/causativity class we choose. The names of the classes,
    respectively, are <strong>intransitive, transitive, direct
    causative,</strong> and <strong>indirect causative</strong>. In the
    maximal case, the indirect causative, we can make up sentences like
    this:</p>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p>मैंने दुकानवाले से अपने दोस्त को मिठाइयाँ दिखवाईं।</p>
    <p>ma͠i-ne dukān-vāl-e se apn-e dost ko miṭʰāi-yā̃ dikʰ-vā-ī̃</p>
    <p>1SG.ERG store-NMZ-OBL.SG by own-OBL.SG friend DAT sweet-NOM.PL
    see-IND.CAUS-F.PL</p>
    <p>“I made the storekeeper show my friend the sweets.”</p>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Back to the point.</strong> What did I find weird here? Well,
    we have the kind of verb that takes the maximal number of arguments, an
    indirect causative with 4 arguments! But here there’s just one argument.
    The other arguments must be implied. Well, let’s think about it.
    Clearly, you take the initiative in getting yourself vaccinated, someone
    else (like a nurse) applies the vaccine, and the vaccine is the thing
    applied. So we can fill the following slots:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Subject: <strong>you</strong> initiate the applying it</p></li>
    <li><p>Object: <strong>vaccine</strong> gets applied</p></li>
    <li><p>Indirect object: <strong>you</strong> get applied to</p></li>
    <li><p>Instrument: <strong>nurse, doctor, health worker, etc.</strong>
    is made to apply it</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>With this verb, when we don’t specify the arguments besides the
    object (the vaccine), the subject and indirect object are implied to be
    the same! Meanwhile, the instrument is unspecified, there is no
    restriction on who it could be.</p>
    <p>Now, the importance of the start of this post should be clearer. This
    is sort of like a Sanskrit <em>ātmanepada</em> verb. When we don’t say
    the arguments, it is implied that we are applying this action to
    ourselves. It is easy to find examples of टीका लगवाना <em>ṭīkā
    lagvānā</em> being used this way.</p>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p>१८२ नागरिकों ने स्थानीय केन्द्रों पर पहुंचकर टीका लगवाया।</p>
    <p>“182 citizens reached the local centres and got [themselves]
    vaccinated.”</p>
    </div>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p>बूथ पर लोगों ने रजिस्ट्रेशन कराने के बाद टीका लगवाया।</p>
    <p>“After getting registered at the booth, people got [themselves]
    vaccinated.”</p>
    </div>
    <p>So is this a new kind of language change going on in Hindi? Are we
    reviving the <em>ātmanepada</em> category? I don’t actually think so.
    I’m having a hard time thinking of other verbs that automatically assume
    the subject = indirect object in this way. If you say मैंने खाना खिलवाया “I
    made [someone] feed [someone else]” that kind of implication does not
    take place. So I’m curious what’s going on here.<span class="sidenote-number">

    <h2 id="maybe-its-dialectal">Maybe it’s dialectal?</h2>
    <p>This is not the first time I’ve thought about reflexive causatives in
    Hindi. There was <a
    href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE"
    rel="nofollow ugc noopener">a conversation I had on a Wiktionary talk
    page</a> with Itsmeyash31, who was working with me in cleaning up the
    code for generating Hindi conjugation tables there. He claimed his
    dialect of Hindi, from the “eastern” area (so somewhere in Uttar
    Pradesh) frequently used reflexive <strong>direct</strong> causatives.
    So verbs like मरा- <em>marā-</em> “to get killed” could imply the
    subject being the object.</p>
    <p>I don’t think the examples he presented totally sounded grammatical
    for my Delhi Hindi dialect.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>तुम बेचाओगे। (<em>tum becāoge.</em>) — You will get (yourself)
    sold.</p></li>
    <li><p>वो चीज़ें आज ही बेचाएँगी। (<em>vo cīzẽ āj hī becāeŋgī.</em>) — Those
    things will get sold today itself.</p></li>
    <li><p>तुम पलटाओगे। (<em>tum palṭāoge.)</em> — You will get (yourself)
    flipped over. / You will get (someone/something) flipped over.</p></li>
    <li><p>तुम पिटाओगे। (<em>tum piṭāoge.)</em> — You will get (yourself)
    beaten.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>I can think of sentences like तू लुटवाएगा “you’ll get us scammed”, तू
    मरवाएगा “you’ll get us killed” which imply the object, but it’s not the
    same, since these are with indirect causative, which just sounds more
    natural here to me. Ultimately, I think the issue comes down we don’t
    have data about this kind of usage so we can’t really say whether it’s
    dialectal, restricted to particular verbs only, restricted to spoken
    colloquial language, etc.</p>
    <p>But anyways, I hope you found that interesting and learned a bit
    about Hindi verbs behaving weirdly.</p>
