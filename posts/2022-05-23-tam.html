<p>Hindi is the best-studied language in South Asia. It would not be the
    worst thing if every linguist working on Hindi decided to take a break
    and pick any other language of the region to study. Nonetheless, Hindi
    does not set a relatively high bar for linguistic investigation when
    compared to other languages of the world; there is plenty that simply
    hasn't been described in any work by a linguist, let alone analysed or
    explained.</p>
    <p>I've gone through several grammars of Hindi in my decade-long quest
    to recover something close to native-speaker status in my L1. (This is a
    not uncommon frustration among Indian-Americans.) My favourite is Kachru
    (2006), which covers many aspects of the language in a fairly accessible
    format. It was the first linguistic grammar I ever read and probably the
    only one I've ever gone through cover-to-cover. But surprisingly, there
    are many strange properties of Hindi morphosyntax that I have not seen
    described in any comprehensive grammar, and none of the papers I've
    read. This is an attempt to document some of these verb forms.
    Imperatives are also attested.</p>
    <h2 id="vpfv-karnā">V[pfv] <em>karnā</em></h2>
    <p>This construction is used to express a very habitual action. I have
    largely seen it in the past tense; it seems weird to use it with other
    tenses, and web searches informally appear to only attest the past
    tense.</p>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p>pūr-e din mẽ ḍeṛʰ rupa-e k-ā ek vaṛā-pāv <strong>kʰā-y-ā</strong>
    <strong>kar-t-ā</strong> tʰ-ā</p>
    <p>whole-M.OBL day LOC 1½ rupee-OBL GEN-M.SG one vada.pav eat-PFV-M.SG
    do-IPFV-M.SG be.PST-M.SG</p>
    <p>“In the whole day, he used to eat a single 1½-rupee vada pav.”
    (<em>Dai̯nik Bʰāskar</em>)</p>
    </div>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p>hāy mar jā-ẽg-e / ham to luṭṭ jā-ẽge / ai̯s-ī bāt-ẽ
    <strong>kiy-ā</strong> nā <strong>kar-o</strong></p>
    <p>sigh die go-FUT.1PL-M.PL / 1PL TOP be.looted go-FUT.1PL / such-F.PL
    talk-PL do.PFV-M.SG NEG do-IMP.2PL</p>
    <p>“Oh, I’ll die / I’ll be made worthless / Don’t keep saying such
    things!” (<em>Āj jāne kī zidd nā karo</em>, Farīdā Xānum)</p>
    </div>
    <p>What is weird is that the main verb takes the perfective while the
    light verb takes the imperfective, which makes no sense at all since
    that assigns conflicting aspectual values to the event! That violates
    one of the usual properties of serial verb constructions universally:
    shared aspectual features on all verbs in the SVC.</p>
    <p>The usual way to express a habitual action in Hindi is the
    imperfective (see below).</p>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p>vo roz jā-t-ā tʰ-ā</p>
    <p>3SG every.day go-IPFV-M.SG be.PST-M.SG</p>
    <p>“He used to go every day.”</p>
    </div>
    <p>The perfective, however, is ambiguously the habitual or just a single
    event, without extra information. In the sentence above, the temporal
    adjunct <em>roz</em> makes it clear that the event repeats. Compare
    this:</p>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p>vo jā-t-ā h-ai̯</p>
    <p>3SG go-PFV-M.SG be-3SG</p>
    <p>“He goes (once/habitually).”</p>
    </div>
    <p>Presumably, with the need to talk about an unambiguous habitual
    event, this kind of construction developed to fill the gap.</p>
    <h2 id="vipfv-rahnā">V[ipfv] <em>rahnā</em></h2>
    <p>The history of <em>rahnā</em> has been studied in the linguistic
    literature, as a transparent grammaticalisation of “to remain” into a
    continuous aspect marker. It's gaining in popularity in other languages
    due to the influence of Hindi–Urdu; see Slade (2013). What's interesting
    here is that it can be used with not only a bare stem, but also the
    imperfective-aspect main verb!</p>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p><strong>jī-te rah-o</strong> beṭ-e</p>
    <p>live-IPFV stay-IMP.2PL child-VOC</p>
    <p>“Bless you, child.” (said when one’s child touches one’s feet)</p>
    </div>
    <p>You may ask again, how can one serial verb construction take two
    different (and contradictory?) aspectual features? I say, the weird verb
    morphosyntax I've been discussing makes an absolute mess of the TAM
    system of Hindi. But note that this grammaticalisation is identical to
    that of <em>stay V-ing</em> in African-American Vernacular English.</p>
    <h2 id="vcnv-rahnā">V[cnv] <em>rahnā</em></h2>
    <p>This is transparently a grammaticaled converbial construction, where
    what was previously literally two separate events (V-ing and then
    staying put) is now analysed as a strong will towards performing the
    event V.</p>
    <div data-gloss="">
    <p>āj <strong>kah-kar</strong> <strong>rah-ū̃g-ā</strong></p>
    <p>today say-CONV stay-FUT.1SG-M.SG</p>
    <p>“Today I will say it no matter what.”</p>
    </div>
    <p>The grammaticalisation of converbs in Indo-Aryan languages is pretty
    interesting. Converbs are prototypically supposed to indicate a separate
    event from that of the main verb, but there are many instances in Hindi
    and other IA languages of a converb describing the same event as the
    main verb, which probably diachronically developed from a more literal
    reading. For example, <em>paṛʰ-ke sunānā</em> “to read then tell” &gt;
    “to read out loud”.</p>
