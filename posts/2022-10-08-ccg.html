  <p>Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) is one of the many, many (far
    too many) syntactic formalisms posited by linguists in the Chomskyian
    era. CCG has been outlined in work by Mark Steedman, the most recent
    guide being <a
    href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Syntactic_Process/5LJaEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0">his
    2001 book</a> which I have to read for a class.</p>

        td, th, .ccg {
            border: 0px;
        }
        .ccg td, .ccg th {
            text-align: center;
            padding-left: 10px;
            padding-right: 10px;
        }
        .ccg th {
            margin-bottom: 0;
            padding-bottom: 0;
        }
        .ccg td {
            padding-bottom: 7px;
            position: relative;
            font-style: italic;
        }
        .ccg td::before {
            font-size: 1em;
            line-height: 1em;
            display: block;
            content: attr(data-trans);
            position: absolute;
            top: -9.5px;
            right: 0px;
            background-color: var(--light);
            font-style: normal;
        }
        .ccg td {
            padding-bottom: 7px;
            position: relative;
            font-style: italic;
        }
        .ccg td[data-trans] {
            padding-top: 0;
            border-top: 1px solid black !important;
        }
        ol {
            list-style-type: none;
        }
        ol > li:before {
            content: '(' counter(bruh) ')';
            position: absolute;
            left: -2em;
        }
        ol > li {
            counter-increment: bruh;
            position: relative;
        }
    </style>
    <p>Unlike most other syntactic theories, I find the mechanics of CCG
    very elegant. There is no difference between the distributional
    categorisation of a lexeme and the argument structure that it has; both
    are neatly contained in the CCG type system, and the connections to type
    theory just work out very nicely (with the caveat that this is in my
    limited understanding of type theory).</p>
    <p>Naturally, I was thinking about how CCG would be applied to Hindi
    syntax. This isn’t anything novel (see this <a
    href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-017-9379-6">2017
    paper</a> on exactly that) but for my own edification I wanted to see
    how flexible CCG is across languages. Here’s CCG analysis of some simply
    clauses in Hindi; as you can see, all the derivations proceed backwards,
    which makes sense since Hindi is pretty left-branching.</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p><img src="/static/img/ccg/1.png" /></p></li>
    <li><p><img src="/static/img/ccg/2.png" /></p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>So, those were pretty straightforward; note that I also included a
    weak functional representation of the semantics in the same lambda
    calculus of Steedman. You can see that the familiar (S)/NP of English is
    replaced with (S), corresponding to SOV structure in Hindi (both verbal
    arguments are to the left). I do wonder how a language where the object
    is further than the subject would work though.</p>
    <p>Here’s a more complex clause, with a ditransitive verb as well as
    another example with non-canonical word ordering. The preferred way to
    analyse non-SOV orderings (which are canonical in Hindi) is with
    type-raising and then forward composition (a rare rightwards
    derivation). I am reminded of how CCG handles relative clauses in
    English, which have screwed-up word order due to an argument being moved
    out of the clause.</p>
    <ol start="3" type="1">
    <li><p><img src="/static/img/ccg/3.png" /></p></li>
    <li><p><img src="/static/img/ccg/4.png" /></p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>One thing I would like to explore is ergativity. Ergativity has been
    studied to death by Hindi linguists, unfortunately. But I like how you
    can easily express the verbal ergative agreement using a feature on the
    subject, which even works well where a serial verb overrides the
    agreement of a main verb. Also, check out all the nice left
    derivations!</p>
    <ol start="5" type="1">
    <li><p><img src="/static/img/ccg/5.png" /></p></li>
    <li><p><img src="/static/img/ccg/6.png" /></p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here’s how <em>lenā</em> and <em>cuknā</em> are handled as serial
    verbs; the former takes the ergative and the latter does not. The
    backward composition operation overrides the unspecified subject type of
    the bare verb <em>kar</em>.</p>
    <ol start="7" type="1">
    <li><p><img src="/static/img/ccg/7.png" /></p></li>
    <li><p><img src="/static/img/ccg/8.png" /></p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Dative subjects:</p>
    <ol start="9" type="1">
    <li><img src="/static/img/ccg/9.png" /></li>
    </ol>
