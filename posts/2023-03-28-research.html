  <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600;"><a href="/index.html">Aryaman Arora</a> » <a href="/blog.html">Blog</a> » Me and Research</p>

  <p>I started doing research in the summer before my senior year of high
    school, the summer of 2019. I’m closing in on 4 years now. The time I
    have been doing research subsumes the COVID-19 pandemic as well as my
    entire undergraduate education at Georgetown. I was 16 when I started
    doing research and I am 20 now. If I have an expected lifespan of ~80
    years, then I hope I get to have 60 more years of research left in
    me.</p>
    <p>To be completely honest though, I got into research because I wanted
    to maximise my chances of getting into MIT. Those days in high school
    were not so long ago, when dreams had a timeline extending to college
    and no further, when everything seemed so <em>immediate</em> and
    <em>important</em>. <strong>Fun fact</strong>: I did not get into MIT.
    Thankfully, research has stuck with me though.</p>
    <p>It infuriates me now how cynical my original motivations were. My
    attitude towards major life decisions as a high school student bordered
    on careerist. I wanted to do things for the sole reason that they would
    look good on my application. I had very little respect for what I
    learned in school beyond the final grade or AP score, even though I did
    pretty well. I also had an inflated sense of my own abilities—it got
    better after I moved to D.C., a bigger city where people had greater
    aspirations and the impressive accomplishments to back them up. But I
    really did expect to get into any college I wanted.</p>
    <p>I don’t think such an attitude is uncommon among many high school
    student in the United States today. The nature of college admissions has
    a big role to play in this; people optimise for what is rewarded, and
    when there are a lot of people and very few spots the optimisation
    gradient blows up. It does kind of suck though.</p>
    <p>What even is research? I don’t think I have a great answer. I think
    the name for it carries a lot of baggage. Maybe at its core, research is
    just about asking questions. Just a fancy name for applying one’s innate
    sense of curiosity. Unlike much of what we deal with in everyday life,
    the search space in research is infinite. Everything I did in life
    before research had a finite search space, in contrast—there are <span
    class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> prestigious colleges that are
    worth going to, there are <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>
    acceptable fields of study (and they are all STEM), there are <span
    class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> places worth working at and the
    metric to optimise is a 1-dimensional scalar called “salary”. Such a big
    world with so little that we understand, and we carve out tiny domains
    to fit our whole lives into.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>At the urging of my mom,<span class="sidenote-number">
      <small class="sidenote">I truly do not know now why I didn’t really want to
        cold-email people for research opportunities then. Maybe I thought it
        would be embarrassing? Cold-emailing is great.</small>
    </span> I cold-emailed a lot of
    people in the summer of 2019 to try and get to work on a research
    project. I had some vague idea that I wanted to do computer science
    stuff, but also with linguistics if possible. I emailed a professor
    working on compilers, some lab in D.C., maybe a couple others I don’t
    remember. Funnily enough, only my first email got a response, the one I
    was most hoping to hear from—<a
    href="https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/">Nathan Schneider</a>
    at Georgetown University, who worked (and still works) on computational
    linguistics. About a week passed between the email and the response, and
    then I responded immediately on July 2nd. I didn’t hear back for 3
    weeks, and got pretty worried because I was starting to get excited
    about it! Fortunately it worked out, and I got to meet Dr. Schneider and
    his Ph.D. student Luke Gessler on August 5th, 2020.</p>
    <p>My first research project was on computationally modelling schwa
    deletion in Hindi, i.e. throwing machine learning methods at the problem
    and hoping it works.<span class="sidenote-number">
      <small class="sidenote">I guess many of the everyday things we work on in NLP
        are of this nature.</small>
    </span> This was my first time doing a real
    machine learning project. I had played around with neural networks once
    before, for my final project for the online class CS50x where I first
    learned programming. It was a really dumb neural network for playing
    Connect 4, and since I didn’t know what backprop was I implemented
    “genetic algorithms”, a fancy way of saying I tried a bunch of random
    initialisations for the network weights and had them play each other. It
    was really fun. But I digress; now, I got to apply neural networks to a
    real problem.</p>
    <p>The project was pretty successful if you look at the metrics. We beat
    out a lot of previous hand-crafted methods in the literature and I got
    to write my first paper—well, it was more like “learned to write a paper
    from the example of Luke and Nathan and wrote a few things here and
    there myself”—which ended up getting accepted at ACL. But I would not
    say I fell in love with research at that point. I liked the work and I
    definitely preferred it to schoolwork. I guess I would say that <a
    href="https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/">I liked working on hard
    problems</a>, and this was a hard problem. Solving it was
    satisfying.</p>
    <p>The first research project I did where I truly felt driven by my own
    curiousity about it was extending <a
    href="https://aclanthology.org/P18-1018/">SNACS</a> to Hindi. I spent
    the summer of 2020 working on SNACS annotation of the English version of
    <em>The Little Prince</em> with some of the grad students at Georgetown
    (I had gotten accepted there and committed for undergrad). I got the
    idea in May to try and extend this to Hindi, mostly out of curiosity as
    to whether it would really work, since Hindi’s case markers were way
    more complex than English prepositions. I wrote up a basic annotation
    guidelines document, did a bunch of example sentence annotations myself.
    Research is basically <a
    href="https://xkcd.com/356/">self-nerd-sniping</a> and I had nerd-sniped
    myself for the first time. In fact, I did not realise that this is what
    happened until I sat down to write this. Unlike most things I had done
    before then, I really just was curious about this and had no ulterior
    motives driving my desire to work on the problem.</p>
    <p>From that point onwards, everything that I have worked on has been
    motivated by my own interest and love for the problem. Sure, there are
    frustrating moments—sometimes there’s a seemingly unsolvable bug in the
    code, sometimes revising papers and dealing with collaborators is a
    pain, sometimes the problem doesn’t feel exciting. But, like any loving
    and healthy relationship, if it is worth doing you slog through the
    tough parts and are rewarded for it. It seems to me that the motivations
    for working on research should be a lot of curiosity (“Why?”), a belief
    in the importance of the problem, and a little bit of dissatisfaction
    with the <em>status quo</em>.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>I basically just started research and don’t consider myself
    particularly good at it. I am still developing my <a
    href="https://colah.github.io/notes/taste/">research taste</a>. I don’t
    think I’ve worked on particularly exciting problems thus far. However, I
    find this fact very exciting because it means the ceiling is so high I
    can’t see it, and I have room to grow and much cooler things left to
    work on. But even beginner researchers get to see amazing things—if you
    spend even a little time with <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information
    theory</a> you get to grasp a little of the beauty of math, if you read
    the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">transformers paper</a>
    and go through the implementation yourself the insights behind it leave
    you in awe. Especially working on problems in AI or adjacent areas right
    now, you get a glimpse of the future and it feels like there are <em>too
    many</em> exciting problems to choose from right now.</p>
    <p>The rest of my thoughts on research were already better articulated
    by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard
    Hamming</a>.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I think it is very definitely worth the struggle to try and do
    first-class work because the truth is, the value is in the struggle more
    than it is in the result. The struggle to make something of yourself
    seems to be worthwhile in itself. The success and fame are sort of
    dividends, in my opinion.</p>
