<p><strong><a href="https://acl2020.org/">ACL 2020</a> was the most
exciting event in my life so far as a proto-computational
linguist.</strong> This was my first conference, and my first published
research paper. I never thought I would be doing something like this
when I started out with computer science (something that was fun and
exciting), and when I started out with linguistics (something that
became a hobby as I sought to improve my Hindi). I learned, I grew, all
while meeting some fantastic people who gave me advice that I will pay
heed to as I continue forward.</p>
<p>I had a great time <a
href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40aryaman2020%20%23acl2020nlp">livetweeting
in Hindi and English</a> as well as joining the myriad extra-conference
sessions.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Downtown_Seattle_skyline_from_Kerry_Park_-_October_2019.jpg" alt="Where the conference would have been :("></p>
<p>And despite the conference being virtual and all the hassles that
entailed, I felt I was able to get to know a lot of people and felt
welcomed by the *CL community.</p>
<p>I decided, in order to protect the important memories that my brain
will discard eventually, to write up some of the things I have learned
as well as my thoughts on the conference itself. Future me will
certainly find it useful, but I hope others do too.</p>
<h2 id="my-paper-getting-there">My Paper, Getting There</h2>
<p>Our paper (my coauthors were <a href="https://lgessler.com/">Luke
Gessler</a> and <a href="http://nathan.cl/">Dr. Nathan Schneider</a>) at
the conference was "<a
href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.696.pdf">Supervised
Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion of Orthographic Schwas in Hindi and
Punjabi</a>". Basically, we focused in on the problem of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa_deletion_in_Indo-Aryan_languages">schwa
deletion</a> in Hindi and Punjabi. That is the primary issue in
text-to-speech for those languages, and we proposed a high successful
machine learning solution.</p>
<p>I've been very luck to get to attend a conference of this magnitude
and quality even before my freshman year of college. The reality is that
lots of things aligned for me being where I am. I'm especially thankful
to have a great mentor in <a href="http://nathan.cl/">Dr. Nathan
Schneider</a>, who has made me super excited to be in this field and
been very willing to teach me, an absolute beginner, as well as great
people to work with like Luke.</p>
<p>So when I got the chance to see the brightest people in the field
gathered together sharing all their ground-breaking work? Of course I
wanted to make the most of it!</p>
<h2 id="papers-talks">Papers, Talks</h2>
<p>My original idea about the conference was that the paper talks would
be the most important part of it. I don't think that's entirely true
anymore—<strong>socializing and talking to interesting people is the
real benefit</strong>. Regardless, I learned immeasurably from the paper
talks. There was no talk that did not teach me something new, and often
I learned about whole subfields that I had not heard of before. (I
admittedly gave up some family Netflix time to binge-watch the talks.)
It was honestly the most exciting thing to me.</p>
<p>For the talks I enjoyed the most I tried to livetweet them in Hindi
under #acl2020hi. (I was assigned the Lexical Semantics track for that
but I livetweeted pretty much anything interesting.) This was beneficial
in a couple ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It forced me to pay attention to what was going on and take
notes.</strong> Surprisingly, I'd don't like saying stupidly wrong
things publicly!</li>
<li><strong>It let me practice my Hindi in an engaging way.</strong> I'm
somewhere between a native and heritage speaker so I always take the
opportunity to get better. I also got to come up with some cool words
like अंतःस्थापन "embedding".</li>
</ol>
<p>The combined mental effort of both of these meant I could get the
most out of every talk and I didn't descend into mindless NLP Netflix.
On the other hand, it made me very tired and I'm not sure it would be as
feasible at a physical conference.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I would advise future me to <strong>always take notes
at conferences</strong>. I think it's important to maximize how much I
get out of events like these, especially ACL because it's only a couple
days of the year. And obviously, it's super exciting to watch (hopefully
"attend" in future years) the talks but <em>remembering</em> what was
exciting is pretty great too.</p>
<p>As for the contents of the talks themselves... they were just so
cool! I hope to be as excited for future conferences as I was for this
one. Some of my favourite papers were:</p>
<ul>
<li>David Wilmot, Frank Keller. “<a
href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.161.pdf">Suspense
in Short Stories is Predicted By Uncertainty Reduction over Neural Story
Representation.</a>”</li>
<li>Mario Giulianelli, Marco Del Tredici, Raquel Fernández. “<a
href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.365.pdf">Analysing
Lexical Semantic Change with Contextualised Word
Representations.</a>”</li>
<li>Kenneth Joseph, Jonathan Morgan. “<a
href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.405.pdf">When do
Word Embeddings Accurately Reflect Surveys on our Beliefs About
People?</a>”</li>
<li>Srijan Bansal, Vishal Garimella, Ayush Suhane, Jasabanta Patro,
Animesh Mukherjee. “<a
href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.96.pdf">Code-Switching
Patterns Can Be an Effective Route to Improve Performance of Downstream
NLP Applications: A Case Study of Humour, Sarcasm and Hate Speech
Detection.</a>”</li>
</ul>
<p>I generally like the way the virtual site was organised. It was very
easy to navigate and the attached RocketChat channels made asking
questions very easy. The only real disappointment of the conference
system was the Q&amp;A Zoom session format, which seemed redundant and
clunky especially relative to the RocketChat. It's still unclear what an
hour-long Q&amp;A was supposed to do. The ones I went in were quite
sparse in audience, and no one showed up to one of mine. Maybe some kind
of live presentation would have been more interesting?</p>
<h2 id="meetings-people">Meetings, People</h2>
<p>The people I met at ACL were awesome and very friendly. I can't think
of any community I've been in that is as welcoming, and *CL is certainly
what I would want any community that I am a part of to emulate. Everyone
I've talked to has been genuinely interested; even in the RocketChat,
people would drop by and say nice things about our paper (as well as ask
great questions). We even got livetweeted about in <a
href="https://twitter.com/oya163/status/1281332828333051906">Nepali</a>
and <a

<p>The Birds of a Feather session that I was able to attend was on
Lexical Semantics, organized by <a
href="https://www.tiagotorrent.com/">Tiago Torrent</a>. It was quite
interesting to see how meaning and structure cooperate and all the
research questions that arise from it (as well as meet the people who
work on it), and I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend more of those
sessions. I also enjoyed meeting the extended academic family of <a
href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/">Noah Smith</a>,
wonderful people at the University of Chicago and McGill University at a
meeting organized by <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/">Jackie
C. K. Cheung</a>, the very cool people who attended the ACL
Undergraduate Panel led by <a href="http://rush-nlp.com/">Sasha
Rush</a>, <a href="https://suchin.io/">Suchin Gururangan</a>, and <a
href="https://sjmielke.com/">Sabrina J. Mielke</a> (although I was too
shy to ask questions in that one, it was still very informative), other
people interested in Low-Resource NLP at the session organized by <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahimsharafelden/?originalSubdomain=eg">Ibrahim
Sharaf</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wellformedness">Kyle
Gorman</a> at SIGMORPHON. It was nice to see all the varied experiences
and interests in the community.</p>
<p>Some of the people who gave me really great advice were <a
href="https://rishibommasani.github.io/">Rishi Bommasani</a>, <a
href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~nfliu/">Nelson Liu</a>, <a
href="https://www.tiagotorrent.com/">Tiago Torrent</a>, and <a
href="https://soldaini.net/">Luca Soldaini</a>. I had many great short
conversations with several other people as well. I learned a lot from
them and these conversations will without a doubt inform the future
steps in my career. It really made me happy to be part of a community
with these kinds of people.</p>
<p>So, to future me, I say <strong>talk to people and don't be afraid to
start the conversation</strong>. It's definitely the most rewarding part
of a conference, to be surrounded by people with the same interests yet
with different (read: more) experiences and knowledge to give.</p>
<h2 id="future-present">Future, Present</h2>
<p>Where do I stand now? What do I take away from this? If there's been
any consistent thread tying all my conversations, all the advice I got,
all that I learned here, it's that <strong>trying new things is
important</strong>. Diversity of experience in the present moment is the
most valuable thing I can have. It's too early to worry about what form
my career will take in a decade, what subfield I'll specialize in, or
even what will happen after my undergrad. I have four formative years in
front of me in which I can figure out what is exciting for me and what I
want to do in the years that follow, so it makes sense that I explore
all my options. I'm sure research is the path I will stay on, but that
doesn't preclude other fields like software engineering, data science,
historical linguistics, and (of course!) all the non-academic portions
of a college education.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is how much I want to remain working on South
Asian languages. It seems the cutting edge of the field is squarely in
the courtyard of English, which is concerning. But I foresee my work
being the most important when it deals with languages like my own,
because they sorely need it. This is probably something I will continue
having to figure out.</p>
<p>And what about the field? It seems, as someone very new, that there
is a reckoning arriving in NLP/CL. People are frustrated with black box
models, increasingly massive data that powers it, and just a general
feeling of not knowing what is actually going on in the field. Sure, the
metrics are up and there is money to be made from those performance
gains. But the fundamental questions of linguistics have not been
addressed at all by NLP/CL. How do we, as human beings, generalize the
rules of language so well? How do we understand languages? How does
language even exist? And, most unnervingly, what are computational
systems even learning that makes these metrics go up? For a new
researcher, this was a great time to have a Theme track at ACL that
examines this from above. I think it's an exciting time to be in the
field, to be grappling with these questions that don't have any clear
answers awaiting us.</p>
<p>And so, <strong>I say ACL 2020 was a success</strong>, not only in
how it occurred but in what I personally got from it. I really look
forward to attending more conferences in the field (and out of the
field!) and to growing as a researcher. I believe that the future is
generally bright. I think good things are happening in the field. And
I'm excited beyond measure at the prospect of having something to
contribute in it.</p>
