  <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600;"><a href="/index.html">Aryaman Arora</a> » <a href="/blog.html">Blog</a> » A machine-learned syntactic tagset?</p>

  <p>I have been fascinated by the ACL 2022 Best Paper, <em><a
    href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.220.pdf">Learned
    Incremental Representations for Parsing</a></em> by Nikita Kitaev,
    Thomas Lu, and Dan Klein. I had the good fortune, wandering around in
    Gather.town, to attend the poster session virtually before the award was
    announced. The big thing that the paper showed is the tractibility of
    human-like incremental parsing, which seems to have been pretty much a
    dormant problem in the field ever since full-sentence language models
    started dominating all the benchmarks. What’s especially crazy is the
    numbers Kitaev et al. produce <em>with only left context</em> for their
    parsing model beat state-of-the-art <em>whole-sentence</em> models from
    just a couple years ago.</p>
    <p>Kitaev and Klein have done a ton of great work on syntactic parsing
    in the past, e.g. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/P18-1249/">this
    paper</a> which introduced attention to constituency parsing in 2018, or
    <a href="https://aclanthology.org/P17-1076.pdf">this one</a> which Klein
    is an author on, achieving SOTA on constituency parsing with a neural
    chart-parsing model for (I think) the first time. Thomas Lu seems to
    have been a fourth-year undergrad at Berkeley at the time when the paper
    was submitted—insanely cool.</p>
    <p>What I found exciting about the paper was two things: (1)
    <strong>vector quantisation</strong>, a technique to induce discrete
    values in the model pipeline while still having the system be end-to-end
    differentiable; and (2) the unsupervised learning of a pretty small
    inventory of token labels, whose distribution is worth investigating.
    I’ve thought about a couple of tasks that would need learned discrete
    labels as an intermediate step, so learning about VQ was a huge deal for
    me (and led me down the rabbithole of variational autoencoders
    recently). But my main topic here today is the learned tagset
    itself.</p>
    <p>While checking out their code, I was excited to see that the model
    can be run <a
    href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X99Vbz9pWv1-w-wZoCHzknYl_EU_GXZc">in
    Colab</a> extremely easily, so naturally I decided to poke around at it.
    The purpose of this post is to list some things I figured out about the
    learned 32-token tagset—I was curious how it compared to the usual
    part-of-speech tagsets that we use. Note that while they largely discuss
    the 256-token tagset with an <em>F<sub>1</sub></em> score of 94.49, the
    32-token one is still really good with a score of 93.50.</p>
    <h2 id="prepositional-phrases">Prepositional phrases</h2>
    <p>One of the first things I thought to poke at were prepositional
    phrase attachment, since it was mentioned in the paper. One thing became
    pretty clear: the thing this tagset is trying to do is very different
    from what conventional POS tagsets are. Part-of-speech tags intends to
    group lemmata with similar distributions together; e.g., the
    <em>Cambridge Grammar of the English Language</em> designs its POS
    tagset by making arguments about distribution, coordination scoping, and
    similar linguistic considerations—this is how it ends up grouping some
    conventional subordinators with prepositions, due to shared acceptance
    of some clausal dependents.</p>
    <p>This tagset, on the other hand, is learned as the sole input in order
    to parse syntax, and that too with only the benefit of left-side
    context. A normal POS tagset, I wager, is not informative enough to
    generate accurate syntax trees by itself.</p>
    <p>A common feature is a distinction between <strong>leading</strong>
    (initial) and <strong>non-leading</strong> tags, sort of like the B and
    I tags of BIO. This makes sense; a leading tag signals the start of a
    new constituent, say an NP, and a non-leading tag signals its
    continuation. But things were not so simple as to let there be only two
    tags for indicating an NP. Below are some minimal pairs I found for
    PP-attachment tags.</p>

    <p><strong>Table 1</strong>: Tags outputted for some PP attachment
    minimal pairs.</p>
    <p>So we see that the tag on the preposition really does signal where
    it’s attaching: to the preceding NP (4), or to the VP (24). Also, there
    is another tag for attaching to the VP when there is no preceding NP in
    the way (17).</p>
    <p>The nouns are sort of screwed up though. There is a clear distinction
    between leading and non-leading tokens, but it’s not just two tags
    involved. We see all of the following: [11, {0, 7, 21}], [28, 21], [16,
    25]. I think this is signalling some kind of syntactic tendency embodied
    by these determiners/nouns, to use for potential dismabiguation as more
    tokens to the right are consumed by the encoder. I’m not sure what that
    tendency is though. Really interesting to find nevertheless!</p>
    <h2 id="attempts-to-describe-each-tag">Attempts to describe each
    tag</h2>
    <p>Because I am excellent at making use of my time, I tried to figure
    out what each tag was conveying syntactically. Some of these
    descriptions are very rough and were before I systematically tried out
    some of the PP-attachment stuff, so do not take them as authoritative. I
    also could not get it to produce all of the tags since I was only using
    it manually (it seemed like a fun challenge). An actual analysis should
    probably run the tagger on the original paper’s test set.</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p>Non-leading NP elements but nested in something. This contrasts
    with 7; if 0 is used, the PP attaches to the NP preceding, but with 7 it
    attaches to the VP as an adjunct.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I saw a man with a <strong>book</strong></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Commas.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When I was young <strong>,</strong> I had no brains</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Fronted verb or auxiliary verb in WH-questions.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What <strong>have</strong> you been doing</li>
    <li>How <strong>dare</strong> you !</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Final punctuation.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I hate commas <strong>.</strong></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Prepositions, complement to VPs. Interestingly, <em>to</em> (in
    the infinitive) falls under this category as well!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>There is some cheese [<strong>in</strong> the
    fridge]<sub>PP</sub></li>
    <li>I did this [<strong>with</strong> the goal of saving
    you]<sub>PP</sub></li>
    <li>I came here [<strong>with</strong> him]<sub>PP</sub>
    [<strong>on</strong> the run]<sub>PP</sub></li>
    <li>I did this [<strong>to</strong> save you]<sub>S</sub></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Non-leading elements of QPs.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>It happened [almost <strong>20</strong>]<sub>QP</sub> years ago</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Verbs in main clauses. Your least fancy verb in the sentence goes
    under this category. Interestingly, this includes auxiliary verbs in the
    clause too. This leads to chains of 6s.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Luna <strong>smashed</strong> the pumpkin</li>
    <li>You <strong>run</strong></li>
    <li>I <strong>will be drawing</strong> a picture of him</li>
    <li>He said that you <strong>are</strong> mean</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>NP complements of PPs.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The power of the <strong>people</strong> is magnificent</li>

    <li>I am a man of the <strong>city</strong></li>
    <li>I saw the planet with a <strong>telescope</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some kind of non-leading NP element (compounds?)</p>

    <li><p>Verbs in nominalised clauses.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Eating</strong> food {is, seems} epic</li>
    <li><strong>Yelling</strong> at people is mean</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Kind of cursed, but also <em>to</em> when indicating a complement
    clause.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I want <strong>to</strong> be the best</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Adjectives in predicate position.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I am <strong>hungry</strong></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Leading elements of non-subject NPs. This one is super
    interesting. So, if the object NP has a determiner, then that determiner
    is labelled 11. But, if there is no determiner in that NP then it’s just
    the nominal labelled that! This makes sense given only left context is
    available to the model; this signals the left-most boundary of an object
    NP.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The man eats <strong>the</strong> food</li>
    <li>The man eats <strong>food</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also seems to include PP objects.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A hungry man is in <strong>my</strong> kitchen</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Verbs in SINV (inverted clauses), as well as where the subject is
    a VP or NP with relative clause. Seems to be an indicator to head back
    up to the S constituent after a pretty complex subject.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Behind every door <strong>is</strong> a fridge</li>
    <li>Eating food <strong>is</strong> epic</li>
    <li>The man who I saw <strong>smells</strong> funny</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Verbs in adjunct clauses.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>[When Luna <strong>smashed</strong> the pumpkin]<sub>SBAR</sub> ,
    she hurt her foot</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Verbs in WH-subject clauses which cause movement.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Who <strong>are</strong> you</li>
    <li>What [have you <strong>done</strong>]<sub>SQ</sub></li>
    <li>What have you <strong>been doing</strong></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>?</p></li>
    <li><p>Leading NP elements of subjects of adjunct and complement
    clauses.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When <strong>the</strong> man was young he lived here</li>
    <li>He said that <strong>you</strong> are mean</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Leading elements of main-clause subject NPs. Interestingly, this
    behaves the exact same way as 11, indicating the leftmost token of a
    subject NP.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>The</strong> man eats the food</li>
    <li><strong>He</strong> eats the food</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also includes subjects of SQ which end up post-verbal.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>How dare <strong>you</strong> !</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Preposition that heads a PP adjunct to the verb.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I am [<strong>inside</strong> a potato]<sub>PP</sub></li>
    <li>We live [<strong>for</strong> the delicious things in
    life]<sub>PP</sub></li>
    <li>Yelling [<strong>at</strong> people]<sub>PP</sub> is mean</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Adverbs (spatial adjuncts, adjective modifiers).</p>
    <ul>
    <li>He lives <strong>here</strong></li>
    <li>Life is <strong>really</strong> weird</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Adverbs (verbal adjuncts in general).</p>
    <ul>
    <li>He <strong>quickly</strong> handed me the potato</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Leading subjects of WH-questions and main clauses with preceding
    WH-adjunct.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What have <strong>you</strong> been doing</li>
    <li>When the man was young <strong>he</strong> lived here</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Adverbial modifiers to S. These nest directly under S, no
    intermediate projections.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>He threw up <strong>today</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Leading direct objects in those constructions where the indirect
    object isn’t in a PP.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>He quickly handed me <strong>the</strong> potato</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Non-leading NP elements. These seem to all be non-leftmost
    elements of the (flat) NP that are nested under a VP or S directly. This
    contrasts with 25.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The <strong>man</strong> [eats [the
    <strong>food</strong>]<sub>NP</sub> ]<sub>VP</sub></li>
    <li>[[A <strong>hungry man</strong>]<sub>NP</sub> has
    arrived]<sub>VP</sub></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In copular clauses, inside the predicate NP following the determiner
    (labelled 28), the nominal is labelled 21 or 25. It seems to be 21 if
    inanimate (or tending towards inanimate?) but 25 if animate. Honestly, I
    have no clue what’s going on here. Maybe the sentence I am testing are
    two short relative to the training data so they confuse the parser, but
    this animacy thing seems to have a point to it!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I am a {<strong>pumpkin</strong>, <strong>cheeseburger</strong>,
    <strong>telescope</strong>}</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Complementiser.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>He said <strong>that</strong> you are mean</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>WH-words. This is used regardless of where they are
    syntactically, in a question, in a relative clause, or as an adjunct
    clause (with <em>when</em>) etc.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>What</strong> have you done</li>
    <li><strong>Who</strong> are you</li>
    <li><strong>Why</strong> are you hitting yourself</li>
    <li>The man <strong>who</strong> I saw smells funny</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Prepositions.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The cat in [<strong>in</strong> the hat]<sub>PP</sub> strikes
    back</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>25 is used for a variety of non-leading NP elements inside the
    VP. One is the first NP with a PP complement. Another is the NP inside a
    PP following the object of the verb, which seems entirely
    counterintuitive.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>There is [[a <strong>man</strong>]<sub>NP</sub> [in the
    fridge]<sub>PP</sub> ]<sub>NP</sub></li>
    <li>We live for [[the <strong>delicious</strong> things]<sub>NP</sub> in
    life]<sub>NP</sub></li>
    <li>There [is some cheese [in [the <strong>fridge</strong>]<sub>NP</sub>
    ]<sub>PP</sub> ]<sub>VP</sub></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have found yet another cursed contrast here though, see 21.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I am a {<strong>man</strong>, <strong>woman</strong>,
    <strong>lady</strong>, <strong>baby</strong>, <strong>machine</strong>,
    <strong>device</strong>}</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Verbs in relative clauses.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>She ate the pumpkin [that Luna
    <strong>smashed</strong>]<sub>SBAR</sub></li>
    <li>[What you <strong>said</strong>]<sub>SBAR</sub> was wrong</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>?</p></li>
    <li><p>NP-leading predicate of a copular clause. Also in some PPs?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>We are <strong>men</strong> (of the city)</li>
    <li>I am <strong>a</strong> man (of the city)</li>
    <li>I did this [with <strong>the</strong> goal of saving
    you]<sub>PP</sub></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Honestly just a grab bag of weird NPs.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I am [[<strong>four</strong> feet]<sub>NP</sub>

    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Non-leading NP element that is a modifier to an ADJP.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I am [[four <strong>feet</strong>]<sub>NP</sub>
