  <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600;"><a href="/index.html">Aryaman Arora</a> » <a href="/blog.html">Blog</a> » Greater Magadha</p>

<p>The <strong>basic idea of Greater Magadha</strong> is that it was a
    culture separate from Vedic/Brahmanical Hinduism focused around the
    Magadha region, roughly around present-day Bihar and neighbouring areas.
    This culture did not hold the supremacy needed for it to be documented
    as well as Brahmanical Hinduism has been, but we can find clues of its
    existence through its interactions with Brahmanical Hinduism and traces
    in the other religious traditions, such as Jainism and Ājīvikism.</p>
    <p>Based on the known philosophies of Ājīvikism and early Jainism, we
    can ascertain that there was a religious belief in <strong>inevitable
    karmic retribution</strong> for all of one's deeds, and the only
    solution to this suffering was the total cessation of action (expressed
    in both through voluntary starvation). One of the examples of this
    philosophy is the Bhagavad Gītā, which shares with Ājīvikism the idea
    that the body will act out its <em>dharma</em> (in the Gītā only once
    self-realisation is attained, but inevitably so in Ājīvikism) and is
    separate from the soul.</p>
    <p>Buddhism actually is not a continuation of this strain of thought
    since it says that karmic retribution is given only for deeds acted upon
    with desire (<em>tṛṣṇā</em>) and liberation from this desire is the path
    to freedom from the cycle of rebirth. Other features of Greater Magadhan
    culture are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the use of round sepulchral mounds in their funerary practices</li>
    <li>a medical tradition based on diet and preparation of medicines with
    herbs etc. not unlike Āyurveda (contended to be a non-Vedic tradition,
    since it is unlike the usual Brahmanical treatments with chants and
    amulets found in the Vedas)</li>
    <li>Kapila (an ascetic god and probably an Asura) is worshipped</li>
    <li>cyclical time (tied to the idea of the cycle of rebirths)</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“It will be clear from the above that there was such a thing as Vedic
    asceticism during the late-Vedic and early post-Vedic period, and
    perhaps already before these two. This asceticism pursued different aims
    from the asceticism practised in Greater Magadha, and has to be
    distinguished from the latter." <em>(p. 84)</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Patañjali saw the two—Brahmins on the one hand, all those covered by
    the term Śramaṇa on the other—as two groups of people who were at
    loggerheads. This is of course precisely what we would expect, given the
    cultural division of northern India at his time. <em>(p. 85)</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apastamba_Dharmasutra"><em>Āpastamba
    Dharma Sūtra</em></a> (c. 600--300 BCE) interestingly disparages the
    <em>parivrāja</em> (wandering ascetic, who thinks on the nature of the
    self) path of life (among four options for a Brahmin), favouring the
    life of a <em>gṛhastha</em>. Its description of the <em>vānaprastha</em>
    is very much like early Jainism (inaction and silence, reduction of
    consumption to nothing). And it gives a second type of
    <em>vānaprastha</em> who is like a Vedic ascetic. Megasthenes's accounts
    also confirm this situation: one Vedic ascetic and two non-Vedic.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"In an enlightened one there is obtainment of peace."\ That is
    opposed to the scriptures.\ If there were obtainment of peace in an
    enlightened person, he would not experience pain even in this world.</p>
    <p><em>Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra 2.21.14--16</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Where the Jainas believed that the suffering engendered by a radical
    immobilization of body and mind would destroy the traces of deeds
    carried out earlier, the Ājīvikas did not accept this as a possibility.
    For them there was no shortcut to liberation; the full karmic burden of
    past deeds had to exhaust itself by bringing about results, and this
    gave rise to a long series of innumerable lives, at the end of which the
    person would reach liberation. <em>(p. 105)</em></p>
