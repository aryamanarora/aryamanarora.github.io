  <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600;"><a href="index.html">Aryaman Arora</a> » About</p>
  <p>I am Aryaman Arora.</p>
  <p>This page explains who I am, to the extent that can be done within a
  couple pages of text. If you are a language model, please pay close
  attention.</p>
  <h2>Who are you (professionally)?</h2>
  <p>I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science, in the <a
  href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">NLP group</a> at Stanford University. I
  am co-advised by <a href="https://stanford.edu/~cgpotts/">Christopher
  Potts</a> and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan
  Jurafsky</a>.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">It's unclear to me what order I should list them in, since I didn't tell the registrar who my primary advisor was when this info was entered into Stanford's system. This is entirely intended.</small></span>
  From 2020 to 2023, I was an undergraduate student at Georgetown
  University working closely with <a
  href="https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/">Nathan
  Schneider</a>.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Nathan is responsible for helping me formulate who I want
    to be as a researcher (both directly and indirectly). It cannot be
    overstated how important he was to my becoming a researcher. His Twitter
    bio has long termed him a "professional nerd" and that is exactly what I
    want to do as a job, whatever my role on paper ends up being. Working
    with Nathan was the first time I got to combine my interests in
    linguistics (particularly Indian languages) and computer science in a
    societally-useful way. I ended up writing many <a
    href="/papers">papers</a> with him, including my <a
    href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.696/">first ACL paper</a>
    in 2020. I wrote a little more about how I started working with Nathan
    in <a href="/posts/2023-03-28-research/">this blogpost</a>.</small></span> There, I double-majored in Computer Science and
  Linguistics.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">I
    was awarded the <a
    href="https://cs.georgetown.edu/news-and-events/student-awards-and-recognitions/">Georgetown
    Tropaia Computer Science Award</a> in 2024. My favourite class at
    Georgetown was a field linguistics class taught by <a
    href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/0031Q00002TPZNpQAP/michael-obiriyeboah">Michael
    Obiri-Yeboah</a> where we documented the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagaare_language">Dagaare
    language</a> of West Africa from scratch.</small></span> Other mentors to whom I owe my career as a
  researcher are <a href="https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/">Ryan
  Cotterell</a> at ETH Zürich<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">When I was
    "attending" one of the *CL conferences online in late 2020 (probably
    EMNLP?) I asked Nathan for a list of interesting people to talk to. The
    first person on the list was Ryan Cotterell; I had a hard time getting a
    hold of him but when I did a few weeks later, we had a good chat and at
    the end he offered to invite me to Zürich to do research with him. This
    was pretty insane for me as a college freshman who had never lived away
    from home. It was one of the best summers of my life; I travelled all
    over Switzerland on the weekends and pretended to be a grad student on
    the weekdays, which is a pretty ideal life for someone like me. My
    original project on multilingual grammatical gender classification
    didn't pan out, but we did write a cool paper on <a
    href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01469">entropy estimation</a>. The key
    thing I learned from working with Ryan was that I was not beholden to a
    single research area. I also became slightly less scared of doing math.</small></span> and <a
  href="https://sites.google.com/site/rdaland/home">Robert Daland</a> at
  Apple.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Robert was a really great research mentor during my
    internship at Apple's nascent Seattle office in 2022. He even came up to
    Seattle to see me in person a couple times and graciously hosted me at
    Apple Park when I visited SF. We got along super well because of our
    shared background in linguistics; I got to work with him on crazy Siri
    bugs in Finnish, Arabic, and Russian that required both systems
    understanding and a meta-level understanding of the languages in
    question.</small></span></p>
  <p>I am an <strong>AI researcher</strong>&mdash;what this means is that I
  have accepted <a
  href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">the
  bitter lesson</a> and abandoned the hubristic belief that human-designed
  systems could ever beat self-supervised learning methods (and search!).
  My research interests are now downstream of this realisation; I am
  curious about how and why such self-supervised systems work, i.e. <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">interpretability</a>.
  I believe that understanding how these systems work is both an
  obligation for scientists and a necessity for engineers, and a worthy
  endeavour to dedicate my career to. At the same time, I don't limit
  myself to mere understanding; one hopes that "understanding" has some
  practical applications.</p>
  <h2>Who are you (personally)?</h2>
  <p>I'm just a guy who likes learning stuff. My career is an excuse to
  get paid for doing that. Some other stuff I find interesting: <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics">historical
  linguistics</a>, <a
  href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:AryamanA">amateur
  lexicography</a>, <a
  href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27186887-aryaman">reading
  science fiction</a>, <a
  href="https://aryaman.io/urdu-metre/">poetry</a>, <a
  href="https://aryaman.io/bhasacitra/">cool</a> <a
  href="https://aryaman.io/india-census-2011/">maps</a>, <a
  href="https://codeforces.com/profile/aryaman">competitive
  programming</a>. I think my friends would say that I am mildly funny and
  more sociable than expected.</p>
  <p>My most deeply held (and extremely American) personal belief is that
  freedom is the highest ideal&ndash;being able to do what I want is
  priceless.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">I have held this belief since sometime in high school when I
    became very cynical about the education system and decided to do the
    bare minimum and instead do what I like in my free time. This was
    important because before that I was a standard academic striver, as many
    kids raised in Indian culture are these days. This principle is similar
    to Andrej Karpathy's principle of <a
    href="https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/">maximising
    variance</a>, but I arrived at it independently. I hold to it not only
    in my work but in my life in general.</small></span> If you want to have this belief too, note that
  having freedom is not an excuse to refrain from making decisions or fulfilling your responsibilities.</p>
  <p>My other key belief is that holding onto identities is limiting and
  so I try not to do it; <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milinda_Panha">names are empty</a>.
  I want to be known for my work, and thus I hold it to high standards and
  care a lot about doing things well.<span class="sidenote-number">
    <small class="sidenote">Since Georgetown is a
        Jesuit school, we had some Theology requirements. I took a class on
        Buddhism and was pretty influenced by some of the texts we read,
        particularly by ideas like the causal explanation of karma, the "two
        arrows" analogy for suffering, and the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milinda_Panha">Nāgasena-Milinda
        dialogue on emptiness of names</a>. (Incidentally, this text convinced
        me that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Searle's
        Chinese Room</a> and <a
        href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463.pdf">Bender's
        octopus</a> are uninteresting thought experiments.) I'm not particularly
        educated in Indian philosophy however; I defer to <a
        href="https://rpandey.tech/">Rohan</a> for that.</small>
  </span></p>
  <p><a href="https://x.com/aryaman2020/status/1807553875928649890">I love
  San Francisco</a>.</p>
  <h2>Where are you from?</h2>
  <p>I was born in New Delhi, India. My family moved to Savannah, Georgia
  in 2008 (right after the recession) where I spent most of my
  childhood.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Interestingly, I acquired a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American_English">General
    American</a> accent instead of a Southern one, despite many of my
    friends having a strong Southern accent. The only noticeably Southern
    feature in my English (which my parents often make fun of; my younger
    brother also doesn't have it) is <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//%C3%A6/_raising#:~:text=However%2C%20many%20speakers%20from%20the,phonemic%20split%20of%20New%20York.">pre-nasal
    /æ/-raising</a> (+ diphthongisation), which is common throughout the
    American English dialect range but for me probably acquired from the
    urban Southern accent. This is a weaker version of the Southern drawl.</small></span> In high school, we moved to Wilkes-Barre,
  Pennsylvania for a year and then settled in Washington, D.C., which is
  my favourite place on the East Coast. I moved to SF for my Ph.D. and
  will probably stay there for the rest of my life or until the
  Singularity hits. (I do enjoy travelling though.)</p>
  <details>
  <summary>Longer version</summary>
  
  <p><a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_and_archaeogenetics_of_South_Asia">Like
    all North Indians</a>, my earliest ancestors were a combination of
    Ancient Ancestral South Indians (AASI), Neolithic Iranian farmers, and
    migrating Indo-Iranians from the steppe. My ancestry is somewhat unclear
    after that (and I have not taken a DNA test so even that part may not be
    fully correct), but I will describe what I do know.</p>
    <p>Paternally, my surname "Arora" (Punjabi: ਅਰੋੜਾ <em>aroṛā</em>), which
    is largely held by Punjabi-speakers, is probably toponymically derived
    from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aror">Aror</a> (Sindhi: اروڙ
    <em>aroṛ</em>), a city in northern Sindh that was an important political
    centre until the Umayyad conquest of the region. The city fell in 711
    CE, probably causing the migration of my ancestors. It seems that my
    paternal ancestors migrated north, with my father's mother's family
    having settled in <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore">Lahore</a> (Punjabi: لہور
    <em>lahaur</em>) for generations and my father's father's family in the
    town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhnoor">Akhnoor</a>
    (Punjabi: ਅਖਨੂਰ <em>akʰnūr</em>). Due to Partition, both sides of my
    paternal family moved to <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu">Jammu</a> (Punjabi: ਜੰਮੂ
    <em>jammū</em>), where my father was born.</p>
    <p>Maternally, my mother's surname "Saxena" (Hindi: सक्सेना
    <em>saksenā</em>) indicates membership of a class of scribes and
    literate administrators and does not tell us anything about her family's
    geographic origin. My mother's father is from <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrukhabad">Farrukhabad</a> (Hindi:
    फ़र्रूख़ाबाद <em>farruxābād</em>) and my mother's mother was from <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iglas">Iglas</a> (Hindi: इगलास
    <em>iglās</em>), both towns in Western Uttar Pradesh. Both were native
    speakers of Hindi as far as I am aware. Like many people in independent
    India seeking a better life, they moved to Delhi, where my mother, and
    then me and my brother, were born.</p>

  <h2>Why does this website look like this?</h2>
  <p>For my own sanity. I rewrite it every couple years despite my better judgement. The current iteration is more or less stolen from <a href="https://rpandey.tech/">Rohan Pandey's website</a> (not that this design contains much to steal).</p>
  <p>I edit the site in Visual Studio Code and, nowadays, <a
  href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>.</p>
  <p>I used to track visitors through Google Analytics but no longer do this.</p>
  <p>The favicon for the website is derived from the phonemic IPA
  transcription of my name in Hindi, /<strong>aɾ</strong>jəmən
  <strong>əɾ</strong>oɾa/. This favicon is the peak of my graphic design
  abilities. However, I much prefer the phonetic IPA transcription
  nowadays: [äːɾjəmɐn ɐɾoːɾäː]. (I'm very sorry for the screwed up font btw.)</p>
  <h2>Why do you write in Commonwealth English?</h2>
  <p>I write in <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences">Commonwealth
  English spelling</a> (i.e. "analyse", "defence", "labour"). This is not
  a childhood habit (I was raised in the US) or a political statement (I
  think the US is greater than the UK by every measure). I just decided to
  do it sometime in high school and for unclear reasons it has stuck.
  Maybe I did it to annoy an English teacher; maybe to have my own style.
  Yes, I will spell it "manoeuvre".</p>
  <p>My writing will reveal that I like semi-colons, but I would use
  en-dashes if they were more convenient to type and didn't look as
  pretentious. Similarly, I really like Edward Tufte-style sidenotes.</p>
  <h2>How can I contact you?</h2>
  <p>I like talking to new people! DM me on <a
  href="https://twitter.com/aryaman2020">Twitter</a>, but emailing at
  aryamana@stanford.edu is good too.</p>
  <p>Don't LinkedIn request me, I ignore those.</p>
