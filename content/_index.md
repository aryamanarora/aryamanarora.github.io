### About

At Stanford, I'm advised by [Dan Jurafsky](http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/) and [Christopher Potts](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/), and currently rotating with [Noah D. Goodman](https://cocolab.stanford.edu/ndg). My research is focused on (mechanistic) **interpretability**.

I want to understand how neural networks, particularly language models, work. To that end, I'm excited about causal approaches and insights from linguistics. But mainly, I'm just here to learn cool stuff.

I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Linguistics at [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu/), where I worked with [Nathan Schneider](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/). I interned at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) with [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) working on information theory. And I spent time at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) and [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/). (See my [CV](/pdf/resume.pdf) for more.)

Hit me up on Twitter or at aryamana [at] stanford [dot] edu.
