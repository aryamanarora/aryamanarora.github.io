### About

At Stanford, I'm advised by [Dan Jurafsky](http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/) and [Christopher Potts](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/). My research is focused on **interpretability**.

I want to understand how neural networks (particularly language models) work. To that end, I'm excited about causal approaches and insights from linguistics---however, I'm not committed to any particular line of work and am always excited to try new things!

I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Linguistics at [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu/), where I worked with [Nathan Schneider](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/). I interned at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) with [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) working on information theory, as well as at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) and [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/). (See my [CV](/pdf/resume.pdf) for more.)

Hit me up on Twitter or at aryamana [at] stanford [dot] edu.
