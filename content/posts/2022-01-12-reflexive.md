description: "A new kind of language change?"
---

One of the first unfamiliar distinctions that a learner of Sanskrit will
encounter is *parasmaipada* vs. *ātmanepada* verbs. They have two
different sets of morphological endings—a pain on top of the different
endings for the 10 root classes—but often no obvious difference in
meaning. Does it actually matter whether I use *parasmaipada* or
*ātmanepada* forms? Why not stick to one to halve the number of endings
I need to learn?

The learner will be taught that prescriptively, *parasmaipada* (or
active-voice) verbs refer to actions done for the benefit of others,
while *ātmanepada* (or
middle-voice[^1]) verbs are for actions done
for oneself. Take the root पच् *pac* “cook”: if I say पचे *pacē* you
better get your own meal because this is *ātmanepada*, cooking for
myself. If I say पचामि *pacāmi* then feel free to take this food. But in
reality, Sanskrit texts **don’t strictly make this distinction**. Many
verbs will prefer one or the other for no apparent reason, and there is
diachronic change in the preference towards one or the other with not
clear driving factor. Perhaps this distinction was not bearing enough
functional load to remain necessary over time, but awareness of the two
forms, especially after Sanskrit became a formally learned language
rather than an uncodified mothertongue, meant that they continued
competing throughout Sanskrit’s history.

Beyond the situation in Sanskrit, the similarity of the forms between
the two voices meant that by Middle Indo-Aryan, the distinction had
collapsed phonologically and did not survive (to my knowledge) to the
present day in any Indo-Aryan language.

Recently though, I noted a similar feature in Hindi, which I don’t think
is really a purely morphological distinction yet like in Sanskrit, but
the parallel is too interesting to dismiss. I’ll call it the **reflexive
causative**.

## टीका लगवाओ *ṭīkā lagvāo*

With the continuing spread of coronavirus in India as in much of the
world, the government has been pushing people to get vaccinated. One
tool to do that is advertising campaigns. There was a nice video from
this kind of drive that I saw the other day:

{{< ex >}}
टीका लगवाया क्या?

ṭīkā lag-vā-yā kyā?

vaccine.M.SG apply-CAUS.IND-M.SG what?

“Did you get vaccinated?”
{{< /ex >}}

One of the things that struck me in that
title[^2] is that the verb, despite
being an **indirect causative** (or double causative) that can take 4
core arguments, has only 1 argument, *ṭīkā* “vaccine/vaccination”,
indicated explicitly at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *A digression into how Hindi’s causatives work…*

Hindi, like other Indo-Aryan languages, has up to a four-way
morphological gradation of transitivity/causativity on verbs. Basically,
for every verb, we have up to four forms that vary in terms of how many
entities are involved in that action. The obvious participants are the
**subject** (thing doing the action) and **object** (action being done
to it), but there are some less obvious ones that show up in this
gradation. An example will show this better.

> दिख- dikʰ- “[Subj] is seen”\
> देख- dekʰ- “[Subj] sees [Obj]”\
> दिखा- dikʰā- “[Subj] shows [Obj] to [IObj]”\
> दिखवा- dikʰvā- “[Subj] makes [Inst] show [Obj] to [IObj]”

The main action in all of these is SEE, but who and what is involved,
who causes the seeing, etc. varies based on what
transitivity/causativity class we choose. The names of the classes,
respectively, are **intransitive, transitive, direct causative,** and
**indirect causative**. In the maximal case, the indirect causative, we
can make up sentences like this:

{{< ex >}}
मैंने दुकानवाले से अपने दोस्त को मिठाइयाँ दिखवाईं।

ma͠i-ne dukān-vāl-e se apn-e dost ko miṭʰāi-yā̃ dikʰ-vā-ī̃

1SG.ERG store-NMZ-OBL.SG by own-OBL.SG friend DAT sweet-NOM.PL
see-IND.CAUS-F.PL

“I made the storekeeper show my friend the sweets.”
{{</ ex >}}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Back to the point.** What did I find weird here? Well, we have the
kind of verb that takes the maximal number of arguments, an indirect
causative with 4 arguments! But here there’s just one argument. The
other arguments must be implied. Well, let’s think about it. Clearly,
you take the initiative in getting yourself vaccinated, someone else
(like a nurse) applies the vaccine, and the vaccine is the thing
applied. So we can fill the following slots:

-   Subject: **you** initiate the applying it

-   Object: **vaccine** gets applied

-   Indirect object: **you** get applied to

-   Instrument: **nurse, doctor, health worker, etc.** is made to apply
    it

With this verb, when we don’t specify the arguments besides the object
(the vaccine), the subject and indirect object are implied to be the
same! Meanwhile, the instrument is unspecified, there is no restriction
on who it could be.

Now, the importance of the start of this post should be clearer. This is
sort of like a Sanskrit *ātmanepada* verb. When we don’t say the
arguments, it is implied that we are applying this action to ourselves.
It is easy to find examples of टीका लगवाना *ṭīkā lagvānā* being used
this way.

{{< ex >}}
१८२ नागरिकों ने स्थानीय केन्द्रों पर पहुंचकर टीका लगवाया।

“182 citizens reached the local centres and got \[themselves\]
vaccinated.”
{{</ ex >}}

{{< ex >}}
बूथ पर लोगों ने रजिस्ट्रेशन कराने के बाद टीका लगवाया।

“After getting registered at the booth, people got \[themselves\]
vaccinated.”
{{</ ex >}}

So is this a new kind of language change going on in Hindi? Are we
reviving the *ātmanepada* category? I don’t actually think so. I’m
having a hard time thinking of other verbs that automatically assume the
subject = indirect object in this way. If you say मैंने खाना खिलवाया “I
made \[someone\] feed \[someone else\]” that kind of implication does
not take place. So I’m curious what’s going on
here.[^3]

## Maybe it’s dialectal?

This is not the first time I’ve thought about reflexive causatives in
Hindi. There was <a
href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE"
rel="nofollow ugc noopener">a conversation I had on a Wiktionary talk
page</a> with Itsmeyash31, who was working with me in cleaning up the
code for generating Hindi conjugation tables there. He claimed his
dialect of Hindi, from the “eastern” area (so somewhere in Uttar
Pradesh) frequently used reflexive **direct** causatives. So verbs like
मरा- *marā-* “to get killed” could imply the subject being the object.

I don’t think the examples he presented totally sounded grammatical for
my Delhi Hindi dialect.

1.  तुम बेचाओगे। (*tum becāoge.*) — You will get (yourself) sold.

2.  वो चीज़ें आज ही बेचाएँगी। (*vo cīzẽ āj hī becāeŋgī.*) — Those things will
    get sold today itself.

3.  तुम पलटाओगे। (*tum palṭāoge.)* — You will get (yourself) flipped over.
    / You will get (someone/something) flipped over.

4.  तुम पिटाओगे। (*tum piṭāoge.)* — You will get (yourself) beaten.

I can think of sentences like तू लुटवाएगा “you’ll get us scammed”, तू
मरवाएगा “you’ll get us killed” which imply the object, but it’s not the
same, since these are with indirect causative, which just sounds more
natural here to me. Ultimately, I think the issue comes down we don’t
have data about this kind of usage so we can’t really say whether it’s
dialectal, restricted to particular verbs only, restricted to spoken
colloquial language, etc.

But anyways, I hope you found that interesting and learned a bit about
Hindi verbs behaving weirdly.

[^1]: There are also passive-voice verbs, but they
    do not neatly fit in this paradigm since they’re derived with the
    suffix *-ya-* and then the person/number endings, and they are not
    really in competition like the active- and middle-voice forms
    are.
[^2]: As a linguist, it’s inevitably a really
    trivial thing that seems interesting to me.

    paper.
